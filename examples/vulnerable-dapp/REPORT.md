## Security Score

# 100/100 ✅

### 🏆 Eligible for ArcShield Verified Badge

This project meets the security requirements for the ArcShield Verified badge.

---

## Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Level:** 🟢 LOW

---

## Executive Summary

Our security assessment of the target system has identified 10 potential security threats, including issues related to tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege. However, no actual vulnerabilities were detected, and the system received a perfect security score of 100/100. This indicates that the target system has strong security measures in place and is well-protected against common cyber threats. To maintain this high level of security, we recommend implementing the following prioritized actions to address the identified threat areas.

## Prioritized Recommendations


### 1. Implement Robust Authentication and Authorization Controls

**Priority:** 1 | **Effort:** MEDIUM | **Impact:** Reduces the risk of unauthorized access and privilege escalation, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the system.

Review and strengthen authentication and authorization mechanisms to mitigate the risk of elevation of privilege threats. This may include implementing multi-factor authentication, regularly reviewing and updating access permissions, and establishing a comprehensive user access management process.


### 2. Enhance Logging and Monitoring Capabilities

**Priority:** 2 | **Effort:** MEDIUM | **Impact:** Improves the organization's ability to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized changes.

Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring solutions to better detect and respond to potential tampering and repudiation issues. This includes reviewing and optimizing log configurations, enabling real-time alerting for suspicious activities, and regularly reviewing audit logs for any anomalies.


### 3. Implement Data Encryption and Obfuscation

**Priority:** 3 | **Effort:** MEDIUM | **Impact:** Protects the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information, reducing the potential impact of data breaches or unauthorized access.

Evaluate the system's data handling and storage practices, and implement strong encryption and obfuscation techniques to mitigate the risk of information disclosure threats. This may include encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit, as well as applying data masking or anonymization techniques where appropriate.


### 4. Review and Test Denial of Service Resilience

**Priority:** 4 | **Effort:** HIGH | **Impact:** Enhances the system's resilience against availability-related threats, ensuring uninterrupted service delivery and mitigating the potential business impact of denial of service attacks.

Assess the system's ability to withstand and recover from denial of service attacks. Implement appropriate measures, such as load balancing, traffic monitoring, and auto-scaling, to ensure the system can maintain availability and responsiveness under high-stress conditions.

## Compliance Notes

The identified threat areas align with common security best practices and industry standards, such as the OWASP Top 10 and the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) framework. Implementing the recommended actions will help the organization improve its overall security posture and compliance with relevant security regulations and guidelines.
