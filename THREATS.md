## 🟠 High Threats

### 🟠 THREAT-001: Unauthenticated User Input Injection

**Category:** TAMPERING
**Severity:** HIGH
**CWE:** CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

#### Description

The application accepts user input through the fallback data flow, but does not implement any authentication or input validation. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious payloads that could be executed by the application, leading to code execution or data manipulation.

#### Affected Components

- `packages/core/src/index.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/utils/index.ts`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could send crafted input to the application's API or CLI, which could be executed by the application without any authentication or validation checks. This could allow the attacker to run arbitrary code on the system or modify sensitive data.

#### Mitigation

Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-supplied data. Ensure that input is properly validated, escaped, and sanitized before being used by the application. Additionally, consider implementing an authentication mechanism to restrict access to sensitive functionality.

### 🟠 THREAT-003: Lack of Authorization Enforcement

**Category:** ELEVATION OF_PRIVILEGE
**Severity:** HIGH
**CWE:** CWE-284: Improper Access Control

#### Description

The application does not appear to have any access control or authorization mechanisms in place. This could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges and access sensitive functionality or data without proper authorization.

#### Affected Components

- `packages/core/src/index.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/agents/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/web/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/genlayer/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/contracts/index.ts`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could gain access to the application and perform actions that are intended to be restricted to authorized users, such as modifying sensitive configuration, accessing restricted data, or executing privileged operations.

#### Mitigation

Implement a robust access control and authorization mechanism throughout the application. Define clear roles and permissions, and enforce them consistently across all components. Ensure that users can only access the functionality and data that they are authorized to access based on their role and privileges.

## 🟡 Medium Threats

### 🟡 THREAT-002: Lack of Logging and Audit Trails

**Category:** REPUDIATION
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information

#### Description

The application does not appear to have any logging or audit trail mechanisms in place. This could make it difficult to detect and investigate potential security incidents, as well as making it easier for attackers to deny their actions.

#### Affected Components

- `packages/core/src/index.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could perform malicious actions within the application, and without proper logging and audit trails, it would be challenging to attribute those actions to the attacker. This could hinder incident response and make it difficult to hold the attacker accountable.

#### Mitigation

Implement comprehensive logging and auditing mechanisms throughout the application. Log relevant security-related events, user actions, and system state changes. Ensure that the logs are properly secured, monitored, and regularly reviewed to detect and investigate potential security incidents.

### 🟡 THREAT-004: Potential Information Disclosure through Verbose Error Handling

**Category:** INFORMATION DISCLOSURE
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message

#### Description

The application does not appear to have any error handling or sanitization mechanisms in place. Verbose error messages or stack traces could potentially leak sensitive information, such as file paths, database connection details, or other system-level details, which could be valuable to an attacker.

#### Affected Components

- `packages/core/src/index.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/utils/index.ts`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could intentionally trigger errors in the application and observe the resulting error messages or stack traces, which could reveal sensitive information that could be used to further the attack, such as file paths, database details, or other system-level information.

#### Mitigation

Implement robust error handling and sanitization mechanisms throughout the application. Ensure that error messages do not leak any sensitive information, and that stack traces are not exposed to the user. Consider using a centralized error handling mechanism to handle and log errors consistently.

---

### 🟡 THREAT-005: Potential Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion

**Category:** DENIAL OF_SERVICE
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

#### Description

The application does not appear to have any rate limiting or resource management mechanisms in place. This could make the application vulnerable to denial of service attacks, where an attacker could overwhelm the system with excessive requests or resource consumption.

#### Affected Components

- `packages/core/src/index.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could send a large number of requests to the application's API or CLI, potentially exhausting the system's resources (such as CPU, memory, or network bandwidth) and making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

#### Mitigation

Implement rate limiting and resource management mechanisms to protect the application from denial of service attacks. This could include limiting the number of requests per second, enforcing timeouts, and implementing circuit breakers to protect against resource exhaustion. Additionally, consider adding safeguards to prevent excessive resource consumption by individual users or requests.
