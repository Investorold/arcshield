## 🟠 High Threats

### 🟠 THREAT-001: Lack of Authentication Mechanism

**Category:** SPOOFING
**Severity:** HIGH
**CWE:** CWE-306

#### Description

The application does not have any authentication mechanism, allowing anyone to execute the security scan and access sensitive scan results. This makes the tool vulnerable to spoofing attacks, where an attacker could impersonate a legitimate user and perform malicious actions.

#### Affected Components

- `arcshield scan`
- `arcshield assess`
- `arcshield report`
- `arcshield verify`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could run the 'arcshield scan' command and provide malicious input to target sensitive systems. The attacker could also access and modify the generated scan reports, as there is no authentication or access control in place.

#### Mitigation

Implement a robust authentication mechanism, such as username/password, API keys, or other suitable authentication methods. Ensure that all entry points and sensitive operations are protected by the authentication system.

### 🟠 THREAT-003: Sensitive Data Exposure in Scan Reports

**Category:** INFORMATION DISCLOSURE
**Severity:** HIGH
**CWE:** CWE-200

#### Description

The scan reports generated by the application may contain sensitive information, such as details about the scanned targets, discovered vulnerabilities, and other security-related data. This sensitive information could be accessed by unauthorized parties, leading to potential information disclosure.

#### Affected Components

- `Scanner → Scan reports (Scan results)`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could gain access to the generated scan reports, which may contain sensitive details about the scanned infrastructure, allowing them to gather intelligence for further attacks.

#### Mitigation

Implement access control and encryption mechanisms to protect the generated scan reports. Consider storing the reports in a secure location, and only granting access to authorized personnel. Ensure that the reports do not contain any sensitive information that could be exploited by attackers.

---

## 🟡 Medium Threats

### 🟡 THREAT-002: Lack of Input Validation

**Category:** TAMPERING
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-20

#### Description

The application does not appear to have any input validation mechanisms in place. This allows attackers to potentially provide malformed or malicious input, which could lead to issues such as command injection, path traversal, or other injection-based attacks.

#### Affected Components

- `User input → Scanner configuration (CLI arguments)`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could provide specially crafted CLI arguments that could allow them to execute arbitrary commands on the system or access sensitive files outside of the intended scope.

#### Mitigation

Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization across all entry points, including CLI arguments. Use well-established libraries or frameworks to handle user input securely and prevent common injection attacks.

---

### 🟡 THREAT-004: Lack of Logging and Audit Trails

**Category:** REPUDIATION
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-223

#### Description

The application does not appear to have any logging or audit trail mechanisms in place. This makes it difficult to track user actions, detect malicious activities, and hold users accountable for their actions.

#### Affected Components

- `arcshield scan`
- `arcshield assess`
- `arcshield report`
- `arcshield verify`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could perform various malicious actions, such as modifying scan configurations or tampering with reports, without any trace of their activities. This would make it challenging to investigate and attribute any incidents.

#### Mitigation

Implement comprehensive logging and audit trail mechanisms to track all user actions, including CLI commands, configuration changes, and report generation. Ensure that the logs are secured, regularly reviewed, and accessible to authorized personnel only.

---

### 🟡 THREAT-005: Potential Resource Exhaustion Attacks

**Category:** DENIAL OF_SERVICE
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-400

#### Description

The application does not appear to have any rate limiting or resource management mechanisms in place. This could make the tool vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where an attacker could overwhelm the system with excessive scan requests or large payloads.

#### Affected Components

- `Scanner → Console output (Scan summary)`
- `Scanner → Scan reports (Scan results)`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could repeatedly invoke the 'arcshield scan' command with large or malformed input, causing the application to consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory, disk space) and potentially become unavailable to legitimate users.

#### Mitigation

Implement rate limiting, resource quotas, and load shedding mechanisms to protect the application from resource exhaustion attacks. This could include limiting the number of concurrent scans, restricting the size of user input, or gracefully handling resource-intensive operations.

---

### 🟡 THREAT-006: Potential Privilege Escalation

**Category:** ELEVATION OF_PRIVILEGE
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-269

#### Description

The application does not appear to have any access control or privilege separation mechanisms in place. This could allow an attacker to potentially gain elevated privileges and perform unauthorized actions.

#### Affected Components

- `arcshield scan`
- `arcshield assess`
- `arcshield report`
- `arcshield verify`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could exploit the lack of access control to perform actions beyond their intended scope, such as modifying the scan configuration, accessing sensitive reports, or executing the tool with elevated privileges.

#### Mitigation

Implement a robust access control system that enforces the principle of least privilege. Ensure that users and roles are properly defined, and that each operation is restricted to only the necessary privileges. Consider using a role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) model to manage access permissions.
