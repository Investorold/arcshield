## 🟠 High Threats

### 🟠 THREAT-001: Unauthenticated User Input Injection

**Category:** TAMPERING
**Severity:** HIGH
**CWE:** CWE-77

#### Description

The application does not have any authentication mechanisms, allowing unauthenticated users to provide arbitrary input that could be used to inject malicious code or commands. This could lead to code execution, data manipulation, or other security breaches.

#### Affected Components

- `packages/core/src/index.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/utils/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/types/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/agents/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/web/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/genlayer/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/contracts/index.ts`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could send crafted input to the application's entry points, potentially leading to command injection, SQL injection, or other types of code injection attacks.

#### Mitigation

Implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques for all user-supplied data. Consider using a security library or framework that provides input validation and encoding features. Ensure that all input is properly validated, sanitized, and encoded before being used in the application.

### 🟠 THREAT-002: Lack of Authentication and Authorization

**Category:** ELEVATION OF_PRIVILEGE
**Severity:** HIGH
**CWE:** CWE-306

#### Description

The application does not have any authentication or authorization mechanisms in place. This allows any user to access and perform any action within the application, including sensitive operations and accessing sensitive data.

#### Affected Components

- `packages/core/src/index.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/utils/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/types/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/agents/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/web/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/genlayer/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/contracts/index.ts`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could access the application and perform any action, such as modifying or deleting data, without any restrictions or authentication.

#### Mitigation

Implement a robust authentication and authorization system that requires users to authenticate before accessing the application. Use industry-standard authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OIDC) and enforce the principle of least privilege to ensure that users can only access the resources and perform the actions they are authorized for.

## 🟡 Medium Threats

### 🟡 THREAT-003: Lack of Secure Data Storage

**Category:** INFORMATION DISCLOSURE
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-312

#### Description

The assessment did not identify any sensitive data paths or encryption mechanisms. This could lead to sensitive data being stored or transmitted in plaintext, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access and disclosure.

#### Affected Components

- `packages/core/src/index.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/utils/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/types/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/agents/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/web/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/genlayer/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/contracts/index.ts`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could gain access to the application's data storage (e.g., database, files) and extract sensitive information, such as user credentials, personal data, or confidential business information.

#### Mitigation

Identify all sensitive data handled by the application and implement strong encryption mechanisms to protect it at rest and in transit. Use industry-standard encryption algorithms and key management practices. Ensure that sensitive data is not stored or transmitted in plaintext.

### 🟡 THREAT-004: Lack of Logging and Monitoring

**Category:** REPUDIATION
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-223

#### Description

The assessment did not identify any logging or monitoring mechanisms in the application. This could make it difficult to detect and investigate security incidents, as well as prevent users from denying their actions.

#### Affected Components

- `packages/core/src/index.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/utils/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/types/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/agents/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/web/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/genlayer/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/contracts/index.ts`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could perform malicious actions within the application without leaving any trace, making it difficult to detect and investigate the incident. Additionally, users could deny their actions, making it challenging to hold them accountable.

#### Mitigation

Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring mechanisms to track user actions, system events, and security-related activities. Use a centralized logging solution and configure it to log relevant information, such as user identities, timestamps, and details of performed actions. Ensure that logs are properly protected and analyzed for security incidents.

### 🟡 THREAT-005: Lack of Denial of Service (DoS) Protection

**Category:** DENIAL OF_SERVICE
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-400

#### Description

The assessment did not identify any mechanisms to protect the application against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This could make the application vulnerable to resource exhaustion, causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users.

#### Affected Components

- `packages/core/src/index.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/utils/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/types/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/agents/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/web/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/genlayer/index.ts`
- `packages/core/src/scanners/contracts/index.ts`

#### Attack Scenario

An attacker could send a large number of requests or perform resource-intensive operations, causing the application to become unavailable to legitimate users.

#### Mitigation

Implement rate limiting, input validation, and other measures to protect the application against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Consider using a content delivery network (CDN) or load balancer to distribute the load across multiple servers. Regularly monitor the application's performance and resource usage to identify and mitigate potential DoS vulnerabilities.
